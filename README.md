# Autonomous_Quad_roter_slam
Quad-Rotor Simulation project using slam for 3-D mapping and shortest safe exit estimator 

Idea:
A quad-rotor that can go around in the building and roam around inside it and make a map of it, it would also tag human lives on the map and would also provide information about the fire in the building. Then It will show up a safe path and also come up with a list of priority of the people struck in the building on the basis of the threat posed to them.


The full Report of the Project is attached in the repository.
